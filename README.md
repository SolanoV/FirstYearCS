# First Year Activity Compilation

This is an archive for the activities I did back in my first year in CS. 
I did my best to sort everything, because the original folder containing all of these,
were a cluttered mess that no human being should ever touch. 

Feel free to look around, the description may say otherwise, but you can judge my
spaghetti code. As for my future self, look back if you ever feel stuck. Although you're
not the type to look at the past, this may help with the endeavor you're facing career wise, assuming you're still in the field of CS. 
If you're just looking back for fun, then do so.
